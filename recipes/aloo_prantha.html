    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hailing from Punjab, India, this is one of my favorite breakfasts of all time! It also happens to be one of the first recipes I learned from my Punjabi mother-in-law, so it holds a special place in my heart.

        In Punjabi families, parathas are made with lots of love and affection, not to mention lots of ghee and homemade butter (makhan). If you lean towards a healthier lifestyle, you can easily opt to roast aloo paratha in oil and serve them with curd (plain yogurt) instead of butter.
        
        In this post, I’ll show you two different methods of rolling the potato parathas. There’s no need to be intimidated; this recipe is really quite simple!</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <div>
         
         <ul>
             <li><strong>Dough made from whole wheat flour</strong> – A basic dough is made with whole wheat flour (atta), salt, oil and water. Making this unleavened dough is very easy and you can either knead it with your hands or in a stand mixer. Do use the Indian atta which is finely ground flour made in a chakki or a stone mill.</li>
        <li><strong> Mashed potato stuffing </strong>– Potatoes are boiled, peeled and then mashed. The mashed potatoes are seasoned with herbs, spices and salt, and then are stuffed in a rolled dough before being roasted or fried.</li>
     </ul>   
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>First, boil or steam 4 medium-sized potatoes in a pressure cooker, steamer or electric cooker. Add enough water in a 2-litre pressure cooker or pan to just barely cover the potatoes.
             <ol>
                 <li>For cooking in a pressure cooker – On a medium heat, cook the potatoes in water for 3 to 4 whistles. When the pressure settles down naturally, remove the lid and drain the water very well. Allow the potatoes to cool enough to handle and then peel them.</li>
                <li>For cooking in a pan – Cover the pan and cook potatoes in water till fork tender. For this method, it helps to peel the potatoes and chop them in 2 inch cubes before boiling because they will cook faster than whole potatoes. Using a colander, drain all the water and allow the potatoes to cool.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If you haven’t done so yet, peel and chop the warm potatoes. Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher.
            <em>If you don’t have a potato masher, use a box grater to grate them and then mash the potatoes with a fork.

            </em>
        </li>
        <li>The potatoes should be mashed very well, with no lumps, chunks or bits. Any lumps in the mix will cause the stuffing to leak out of the dough when rolling.</li>
        <li>Now add the following ingredients, feeling free to vary the spices as you like.
            <ul>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies) or serrano peppers</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon punjabi garam masala powder or Garam Masala Powder</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or cayenne pepper or paprika (optional)</li>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) – or use lemon juice instead</li>
                <li>salt according to your taste</li>
            </ul>
            
        </li>
     </ol>
